# ed2k-software
eD2k software packages, including eMule mods. Most of them are under GPL v2. We archive their executable binary and/or source files here, in case they will be unretrievable in the future. Popular applications hosted on permanent and stable websites like GitHub, SourceForge, such as MorphXT mods, may or may not be archived here.
